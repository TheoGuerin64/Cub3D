[![tguerin's 42 cub3d Score](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/clij0li89016608mlca50td3t/project/3027030)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)

The goal of this project is to create a game similar to Wolfenstein 3D using simple raycasting techniques.

The graphic library used is [MLX42](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42)

## Installation

- Follow the instructions for library installation [here](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42/blob/master/README.md#installation-%EF%B8%8F)
- If you want sound, install Pulseaudio (the installation of Pulseaudio can be difficult on Windows, but the game works fine without sound).
- Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/TheoGuerin64/Cub3D.git`
- Use `make` or `make bonus` depending on which part interests you
- You are now ready to play!

If you encounter any issues, feel free to contact me.

## Usage

`./cub3D` or `./cub3D_bonus` followed by the path of a valid .cub map

## Map bonus designer

It requires python3.8 or higher and PyQt6.

`python3 map_bonus_designer.py -h` for help.
